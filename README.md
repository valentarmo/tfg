# TFG
TFG stands for terminal fighting game. It is a very simple fighting game for the
terminal, currently it only has multiplayer (between 2 players in the same machine)
and Single Player against a very simple (and dumb) "AI".

## Play
TFG is built using maven, so if you want try it, first clone the repository i.e.
`git clone https://github.com/fighur/tfg` then, the easiest way to try it is by generating
a fat JAR. To do this, simply go to the project's root directory and type `mvn package`.
You'll find the JAR under the `target` directory. To run it type `java -jar tfg.jar`
or double click on the file.
