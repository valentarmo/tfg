# TFG
TFG stands for terminal fighting game. It is a very simple fighting game for the
terminal. It has multiplayer (between 2 players in the same machine)
and Single Player against a very simple (and dumb) "AI".

## Play
TFG is built using maven, so if you want try it, first clone the repository i.e.
`git clone https://github.com/fighur/tfg` then go to the project's root directory and type `mvn package`.
You'll find the executable JAR `tfg.jar` under the `target` directory. 

I would not recommended to run it inside a terminal.
